# Networking in Android using Kotlin

Android app to demostrate the networking in android using Kotlin and JetBrains anko libraray. This app loads some random facts from internet.
In Java we need to use the AsyncTask to perform networking requests in android and then update the UI accordingly and to do that we need to override many methods, however Kotlin and JetBrains Anko library makes this updating task more easy. This code demostrates a single activity performing the request using this idea and then updating the UI from the called method itself. To read about the main idea see the references.
